The project starts on the login page where the user can login or signup.
The main API are related to signup/login, after our meeting on 26th of October, you asked me to fix all the models and one of the controllers and convert them to mongoose, I chose the car controller and added the services/config/var files for the variables and functions. Finally, I finished all the tasks in the code challenge and the bonuses, so please check the services.js file in util, all the models in the models folder, the auth controller, routes.js file of car in the routes folder, and app.js.
